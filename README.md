# TakeItStudy
Code used for the Take It! paper for use with the Pepper robot by SoftBank Robotics

NOTE: At the time of the study, the robot's external collision sensors were not functioning correctly so each action has a "Set external anti-collision" block set to false. Precautions were taken to prevent to robot from coming in contact with participants during the study. If sensors are functioning correctly, this block can be removed.
